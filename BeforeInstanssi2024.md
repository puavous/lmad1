# How to prepare for the LMAD1 workshop at Instanssi 2024

Most participants are Finns, but they'll do fine with English instructions, I'm
sure. We're inclusive, and gladly accept international participants, of course.

## What you absolutely need

What you do **not need** to do:

- You don't need to fork, clone or download this library. A snapshot "starter
  package" will be provided at the event. Using this development version at the
  event would be counter-productive.

- You don't need to take a preparatory programming course or worry about
  programming skills. We'll learn as we do at the event.

What you **absolutely need**:

- You need your own laptop and power source to participate. Go shop if
  necessary. It doesn't need to be super powerful - a very basic or refurbished
  used laptop will do just fine.

- Your laptop needs free system space for tool installations even if you don't
  do the installations beforehand. It is not fun to spend the workshop time just
  figuring out what to delete to make space for tools.

## What would really help

What you **should do** if you have the time:

- Download and install the larger platforms and tools that are required: see the
  list and short notes below for your laptop. We'll do this at the event before
  going forward, but there is a lot to download and the wireless network at the
  workshop area might not be set up yet when we start. The more people have
  installed beforehand, the less time we need to spend downloading at the party!

  + On Windows you first need: Windows subsystem for linux (WSL). The default
    Ubuntu distribution for WSL seems to be fine. Follow the official
    installation instructions carefully and make sure you have a normal user
    account and not use only a super-user / root account on WSL. Then, for the
    rest of this story and the workshop, you will be using WSL which is
    essentially Linux.

    TODO (if I have time): Direct link to Microsoft instruction pages on WSL?

  + On all systems (WSL, Linux, Mac) you need: GNU Software development tools
    (at least GNU make, bash, sed), Java run-time environment, ruby

    TODO (if I have time): Exact package names / install commands for ubuntu users

  + Would be helpful: zopfli

  + Could be needed: Chrome browser (the only browser I can verify to really
    work with my codes today because that's the one I normally use)

  + Probably some small things that I forgot here, but the above are the most
    massive downloads that have been a bit of a nuisance on earlier workshop
    start evenings

  Software installations can be tricky - don't worry if it doesn't work on the
  first try. If you don't find installation help before the workshop, we'll try
  to install everything together when we start.

## Further preparations for a smoother experience

What you **can do** to make things go even smoother:

- Plan a concept for your entry: What kind of idea or mood would you like to aim
  for? What is the main idea you want your audience to grasp? Mentally prepare
  to let go of lots of details or execute your concept in a different way than
  could be done in dreams! This workshop deliberately brings tough constraints
  to visual elements, and we only have a couple of days and nights to make your
  concept live.

  TODO (if I have time): Links to some 'concept plan examples'

- Create a preliminary soundtrack using SoundBox, or have a musical friend do
  one for you. Save often as URL. Do not use any recognizable melodies or pieces
  from others - for copyright reasons you must have your own, completely
  original soundtrack. Mentally prepare to let go of parts and instruments also
  in the soundtrack. Two reasons: To keep the final demo interesting with
  graphics, its running length might have to be reduced. To be able to
  participate in the 4k competition category, there is a hard trade-off between
  graphics content and audio content. They must both suffer to make an entry in
  4k. The song doesn't have to be very long or sophisticated - we're here to
  have fun. Just press some of the white keys in sequance, it's fine...

  TODO (if I have time): Link to some tutorial about SoundBox.. it needs a few
  pointers to get a newbie tracking successfully without frustration..

- Check out some entries that have been created at the workshop earlier, so
  you'll know what to expect, more or less. You may contrast these to high-end
  4k intros by experienced programmers using more elaborate tools than my simple
  library. We can't suddenly become pros at a new thing. This workshop is for
  your very first step towards demo programming, so you'll start with simple
  things. Crawl before you walk or run, so to speak... That said, you are
  allowed to do more elaborate stuff at the workshop and possibly get help for
  what you try to accomplish -- but always with lesser priority than
  first-timers using the lmad1 library!

  TODO (if I have time): Direct links to videos of some earlier
  lmad1-productions in Instanssi streams..

Looking forward to Instanssi 2024 and the workshop,
